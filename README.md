# eris-services

Service Definition Files and their respective `Dockerfile` for the Eris Platform. See [here](https://monax.io/docs/documentation/cli/latest/specifications/services_specification/) for the services specification vis-a-vis `docker run`.

# Installing

By default eris will install most of these services during the `eris init` process. However should you want to import a service manually, place it in `~/.eris/services/myservice.toml`.
